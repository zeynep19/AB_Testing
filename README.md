# AB_Testing
At its simplest, A/B testing is a method for comparing 2 versions of something against each other to discover which is the most successful. 
AB testing practice: A firm has set up a new advertising bidding method. He wants to compare the method in the old (current) system with the method in the new system. He wants to understand which method will positively affect the purchase on his site. For this, A/B testing is done by us.
